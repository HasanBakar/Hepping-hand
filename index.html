            <h1>Diaspora Definition</h1>
            <p>The term diaspora comes from the Greek verb diaspeirō meaning “to scatter” or “to spread about.” As first
                used in Ancient Greece, diaspora referred to people of dominant countries who voluntarily emigrated from
                their homelands to colonize conquered countries. Today, scholars recognize two kinds of diaspora: forced
                and voluntary.</p>
            <p>Forced diaspora often arises from traumatic events such as wars, imperialistic conquest, or enslavement,
                or from natural disasters like famine or extended drought. As a result, the people of a forced diaspora
                typically share feelings of persecution, loss, and desire to return to their homeland.</p>
